        Since childhood, I've always wanted to be an engineer. Before enrolling in a
        military academy to secure an engineering degree, I had no clue how oriented
        the role as an officer would be to project management and leadership!
        Following my honorable separation from the military, I chose to continue my
        pursuit to become an engineer and build functional applications and websites
        with just a laptop and an internet connection...and I love it!
